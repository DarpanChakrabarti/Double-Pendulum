# Double-Pendulum
Simulating and visualizing chaotic dynamics of the double pendulum using Python. Includes animations, energy analysis, phase space plots, and earthquake response modeling.

# Chaos in the Double Pendulum

## 🧪 Description
A computational and visual study of deterministic chaos in the classical double pendulum. This repository implements Lagrangian mechanics, simulates phase-space dynamics, explores damping and earthquake effects, and offers animations using open-source Python tools.
